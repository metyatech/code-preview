# @metyatech/code-preview

A React + TypeScript component for editing HTML/CSS/JS with a live iframe preview and console output. It works in any React app.

## Features

- Monaco editor panels for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (shown only when enabled)
- Live preview rendered in a sandboxed iframe (`srcDoc`)
- Console panel that captures `console.log`, `console.error`, and runtime errors
- File structure panel for virtual file paths and image assets
- Resizable editor columns (drag, keyboard arrows, double-click or Enter/Space to reset)
- Toolbar controls: long-press reset, line numbers toggle, file structure toggle
- Auto sizing for editors and preview (grows with content, respects `minHeight`)

## Installation

```bash
npm i @metyatech/code-preview
```

## Quick start

````mdx
import { CodePreview } from '@metyatech/code-preview';

<CodePreview title="Basic Example" minHeight="240px">
```html
<button id="btn">Click me</button>
```

```css
#btn { padding: 8px 12px; }
```

```javascript
document.getElementById('btn')?.addEventListener('click', () => {
  console.log('clicked');
});
```
</CodePreview>
````

Styles are injected automatically; no stylesheet import is required.

### Next.js App Router

When rendering from server components (including MDX), import the server entry so fenced blocks are parsed on the server:

```tsx
import { CodePreview } from '@metyatech/code-preview/server';
```

When using CodePreview inside client components, use the client entry:

```tsx
import { CodePreview } from '@metyatech/code-preview/client';
```

## Behavior notes

### Visibility rules

- Editors are shown automatically only when the matching code block is provided. Use `htmlVisible`, `cssVisible`, or `jsVisible` to force visibility.
- Preview is shown when HTML exists or the HTML editor is forced on. Use `previewVisible={false}` to hide it.
- Console is shown only when logs exist, unless `consoleVisible` forces it on or off.

### Code block handling

- The first code block found for each language is used as the initial source.
- Multi-line blocks have leading/trailing blank lines trimmed and common indentation stripped.
- Single-line blocks are left as-is, and editors append a trailing newline when missing.

### Virtual file paths and asset resolution

- `htmlPath`, `cssPath`, and `jsPath` are displayed in the file structure panel.
- If `cssPath` is provided and your HTML includes a matching `<link rel="stylesheet" href="...">`, the CSS is inlined for the preview.
- If `jsPath` is provided and your HTML includes a matching `<script src="..."></script>`, the JS is inlined. Otherwise, JS is appended at the end of `<body>`.
- `images` provides a virtual file map. HTML `src`/`srcset` and CSS `url(...)` are resolved against that map. HTML resolution uses `htmlPath`, CSS resolution uses `cssPath`.

Example using virtual paths and assets:

````mdx
<CodePreview
  cssPath="css/style.css"
  jsPath="js/app.js"
  images={{ 'img/logo.png': '/static/img/logo.png' }}
>
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
<img src="img/logo.png" />
<script src="js/app.js"></script>
```

```css
img { width: 120px; }
```

```javascript
console.log('ready');
```
</CodePreview>
````

### Sharing code with `sourceId`

- Instances with the same `sourceId` share HTML/CSS/JS, file paths, and images on the same page (`window.location.pathname`).
- The first instance that provides code blocks (and has `share` enabled) becomes the source provider. Avoid providing initial code in later instances unless you want to override the shared values.
- Partial overrides are supported: later instances can provide only HTML, only CSS, only JS, or any combination. Only the provided languages override the shared values; omitted languages keep their existing shared content.
- Providing an empty code block clears that language for the shared source.
- Use `share={false}` when you want local overrides (including `images` or paths) without updating the shared store.

### Editor and preview sizing

- Editor height is calculated from content and clamped to a max of 600px.
- Preview height grows as content expands and is clamped to a max of 800px. It does not automatically shrink.

### Reset and resizing controls

- The reset button requires a long press (500ms) and resets code, console logs, and the iframe.
- Resizers can be dragged with the mouse, adjusted via arrow keys, and reset to auto sizing by double-clicking or pressing Enter/Space.
- Line numbers are hidden by default and can be toggled in the toolbar.

## Development

- `npm run build`: build with Rollup
- `npm run lint`: lint
- `npm run test`: Playwright component tests (Chromium and full)
- If Playwright fails to start due to cache issues, run `npm run test-ct:clean` and retry.
